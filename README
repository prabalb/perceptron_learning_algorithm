Explanation of high residual error for XOR gate
-----------------------------------------------
XOR gate cannot be trained using a perceptron as it is a non-linear separable function. 
That is, it is not possible to find a straight-line that separates the data space, to a 
region with output '0', and another region with output '1'. The average residual 
error of 0.25 can be attributed to the fact that, if a straight-line is used to bisect 
the XOR data space into two regions (with outputs 0 and 1), there will be at least one 
data with an incorrect position. As the total number of data in a 2-input XOR data space 
is 4, the minimum residual error has got be no less than 1/4 = 0.25.
